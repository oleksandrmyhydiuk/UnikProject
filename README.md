Project: Financial Assistant
 The Financial Assistant is a desktop application built with Python for managing personal budgets. It allows you to track income and expenses, analyze your financial flows with reports and charts, and convert currencies in real-time.
The application is developed using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and Matplotlib for data visualization. The project follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Project Status: In Development
 This project is for educational purposes and is currently under active development. The current version is stable and demonstrates the core functionality, but there is still much work to be done.

Future Plans:
 UI/UX Improvements: Updating the interface design to make it more modern and user-friendly.

 Feature Expansion: Adding new features like debt management, savings goals, and analysis of financial habits.

 Localization (i18n): Implementing a system to change the application's language (e.g., Ukrainian/English).

 Containerization: Using Docker to simplify the deployment and running of the application on any system.
